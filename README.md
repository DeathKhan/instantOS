- Start menu: https://github.com/paperbenni/dmenu
- Window-Manager: https://github.com/paperbenni/dwm
- Terminal emulator: https://github.com/paperbenni/st

All of these are forks of their original [suckless](https://suckless.org) projects. 
Suckless programs are really basic , small and optimized programs that you are supposed to extend to suit your needs
(or use someone elses configuration if you don't want to learn c or/and apply a bunch of patches)

## Requirements:
This requires an server, it does NOT work with wayland as it relies on x utilities

## OS
It works on Arch and Ubuntu. 
Arch being my daily driver is more tested than Ubuntu, if you have any issues, just contact me,
the userbase being that small allows me to answer every single request.
