--------
### instantOS is still in early beta, contributions always welcome

instantOS will be a distro based on manjaro, 
but as of now, the components that are already functional can be installed on top of 
an existing install of either arch or manjaro. 

### Installation on top of an existing distro-install
#### WARNING THIS WILL OVERRIDE ANY EXISTING CONFIGURATION
```sh
curl -Ls https://git.io/JvIfw | sudo bash
```
## Requirements:
This requires xorg, it does NOT work with wayland as it relies on x utilities
