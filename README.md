## Requirements:
This requires xorg, it does NOT work with wayland as it relies on x utilities

## OS
It works on Arch, Manjaro and Ubuntu. 
Arch/Manjaro being my daily driver is more tested than Ubuntu, if you have any issues, just contact me,
the userbase being that small allows me to answer every single request.
